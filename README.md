_The Mythical Person Month_ is a modernized version of the
renowned  _Mythical Man Month_ book.

## Motivation

[The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
by [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks)
is one of the most quoted and insightful books in the history of managing
technology projects.  Yet it is also a product of its times and the stories
[reflect so much sexism](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-66-the-mythical-man-month/)
that it is uncomfortable to encourage our female colleagues to read the book.

Harris, Biencowe, and Telem
([PMC5774006](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5774006/))
state it well when they conclude:

> Ultimately, in language, as in medicine, taking the position that our current approach is
> justified because ‘it has always been our approach’ is not tenable. Much like the adoption of
> any new technology or technique, evolving our terminology will almost certainly cause
> growing pains. However, surgical workforce demographics have changed and are going to
> keep changing. Thus, we must be rigorous in establishing a nomenclature that promotes not
> only gender-inclusive language, but processes that represent the broad racial, social, and
> sexual identities of our colleagues. In the end, achieving linguistic perfection may not be
> possible, but we should strive for the same standards applied to all surgical trainees: make a
> good faith effort, seek consultation when you are unsure, and admit humbly and openly
> when you have erred. The onus is on all of us to challenge our biases and do better.

I could not agree more.  This advice applies just as well to surgeons,
technologists, and any other profession you can imagine.  This repo is
part of my effort to contribute to the "do better" side of the equation.

## Process, Plan and Notes

[Our modernization analysis](Modernization_Analysis.md) is the core reason for
this project and repo.  It details the concerns about word choices with
examples and recommendations for solutions.  I have started implementing these
ideas.  Upcoming pull requests will continue this process in logical phases.

Other notes:

- [Figures and Visuals](Figures_and_Visuals.md) summarize the non-text
  elements of the book that we will find some way to handle.
- [Claude's guide for itself](CLAUDE.md) explains what's going on in this
  repo in more detail than I'm willing to put the effort into.
