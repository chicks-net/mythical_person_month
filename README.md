_Mythical Person Month_ is a modernized version of the _Mythical Man Month_ book.

## Motivation

[The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
by [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks)
is one of the most quoted and insightful books in the history of managing
technology projects.  Yet it is also a product of its times and the stories
[reflect so much sexism](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-66-the-mythical-man-month/)
that it is uncomfortable to encourage our female colleagues to read the book.
