_Mythical Person Month_ is a modernized version of the _Mythical Man Month_ book.

## Motivation

[The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
by [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks)
is one of the most quoted and insightful books in the history of managing
technology projects.  Yet it is also a product of its times and the stories
[reflect so much sexism](https://psychsafety.com/psychological-safety-66-the-mythical-man-month/)
that it is uncomfortable to encourage our female colleagues to read the book.

## Notes

- [Our modernization analysis](Modernization_Analysis.md) is the core reason
  for this project and repo.  It details the concerns with examples and
  recommendations for solutions.  Upcoming PRs will implement most of
  these recommendations in logical phases.
- [Claude's guide for itself](CLAUDE.md) explains what's going on int this
  repo in more detail than I'm willing to put the effort into.
- [Figures and Visuals](Figures_and_Visuals.md) summarize the non-text
  elements of the book that we will find some way to handle.
