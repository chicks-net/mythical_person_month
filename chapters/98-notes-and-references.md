1. Ershov considers this not only a woe, but also a part of the
   joy. A. P. Ershov, "Aesthetics and the human factor in programming," *CACM*, 15, 7 (July, 1972), pp. 501-505.

## Chapter 2

1. V. A. Vyssotsky of Bell Telephone Laboratories estimates
   that a large project can sustain a workforce buildup of 30
   percent per year. More than that strains and even inhibits
   the evolution of the essential informal structure and its communication pathways discussed in Chapter 7.

   F. J. Corbató of MIT points out that a long project must anticipate a turnover of 20 percent per year, and these must be
   both technically trained and integrated into the formal structure.

2. C. Portman of International Computers Limited says,
   "When everything has been seen to work, all integrated, you have
   four more months work to do." Several other sets of schedule
   divisions are given in Wolverton, R. W., "The cost of developing large-scale software," *IEEE Trans, on Computers*, C-23,
   6 (June, 1974) pp. 615-636.

   here. See J. H. Saltzer, "Evolutionary design of complex systems," in D. Eckman (ed.), *Systems: Research and Design*.
   New York: Wiley, 1961. When all is said and done, however,
   I still advocate building a pilot system whose discarding is
   planned.

   finally goes down again.

   been recoded in machine language for reasons of squeezing out the
   utmost in performance. Several programs, originally in machine
   language, have been recoded in PL/I to increase their maintainability."

6. To quote Corbató's paper cited in reference 3: "PL/I is here
   now and the alternatives are still untested." But see a quite contrary view, well-documented, in Henricksen, J. O. and R. E.
   Merwin, "Programming language efficiency in real-time
   software systems," *AFIPS Proc SJCC*, 40 (1972) pp. 155-161.

7. Not all agree. Harlan Mills says, in a private communication, "My experience begins to tell me that in production programming the person to put at the terminal is the secretary. The idea is
   to make programming a more public practice, under common scrutiny of many team members, rather than a private art."

   before the product was designed, much less comparisons of
   a priori estimates and a posteriori data. Ken Brooks suggests
   that bulletin boards on the Internet now provide a cheap
   method of soliciting data from prospective users of a new

   electronically, but the operating system provides no such

   Neither Royce nor others believed one could go through the
   software process without revising earlier documents; the
   model was put forth as an ideal and a conceptual aid. See
   D. L. Parnas and P. C. Clements, "A rational design process: How and why to fake it," *IEEE Transactions on Software
   Engineering*, SE-12, 2 (Feb., 1986), pp. 251-257.

9. A major reworking of DOD-STD-2167 produced DOD-STD-2167A (1988), which allows but does not mandate more recent models such as the spiral model. Unfortunately, the
   MILSPECS that 2167A references and the illustrative examples it uses are still waterfall-oriented, so most procurements have continued to use the waterfall, Boehm reports.
   A Defense Science Board Task Force under Larry Druffel
   and George Heilmeyer, in their 1994 "Report of the DSB task
   force on acquiring defense software commercially," has advocated the wholesale use of more modern models.

24. Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, inventor of Unix, realized early
    the importance of big screens for programming. He devised
    a way to get 120 lines of code, in two columns, onto his
    primitive Tektronix electron-storage tube. He clung to this
    terminal through a whole generation of small-window, fast
    tubes.
