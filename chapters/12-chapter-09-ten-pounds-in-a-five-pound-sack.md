## Program Space as Cost

How big is it? Aside from running time, the space occupied by a program is a principal cost. This is true even for proprietary programs, where the user pays the author a fee that is essentially a share of the development cost. Consider the IBM APL interactive software system. It rents for $400 per month and, when used, takes at least 160 K bytes of memory. On a Model 165, memory rents for about $12 per kilobyte per month. If the program is available full-time, one pays $400 software rent and $1920 memory rent for using the program. If one uses the APL system only four hours a day, the costs are $400 software rent and $320 memory rent per month.

One frequently hears horror expressed that a 2 M byte machine may have 400 K devoted to its operating system. This is as foolish as criticizing a Boeing 747 because it costs $27 million. One must also ask, "What does it do?" What does one get in ease-of-use and in performance (via efficient system utilization) for the dollars so spent? Could the $4800 per month thus invested in memory rental have been more fruitfully spent for other hardware, for programmers, for application programs?

The system designer puts part of their total hardware resource into resident-program memory when they think it will do more for the user in that form than as adders, disks, etc. To do otherwise would be grossly irresponsible. And the result must be judged as a whole. No one can criticize a programming system for size per se and at the same time consistently advocate closer integration of hardware and software design.

Since size is such a large part of the user cost of a programming system product, the builder must set size targets, control size, and devise size-reduction techniques, just as the hardware builder sets component-count targets, controls component count, and devises count-reduction techniques. Like any cost, size itself is not bad, but unnecessary size is.

## Size Control

For the project manager, size control is partly a technical job and partly a managerial one. One has to study users and their applications to set the sizes of the systems to be offered. Then these systems have to be subdivided, and each component given a size target. Since size-speed trade-offs come in rather big quantum jumps, setting size targets is a tricky business, requiring knowledge of the available trade-offs within each piece. The wise manager also saves himself a kitty, to be allocated as work proceeds.

In OS/360, even though all of this was done very carefully, still other lessons had to be painfully learned.

First, setting size targets for core is not enough; one has to budget all aspects of size. In most previous operating systems, systems residence had been on tape, and the long search times of tape meant that one was not tempted to use it casually to bring in program segments. OS/360 was disk-resident, like its immediate predecessors, the Stretch Operating System and the 1410-7010 Disk Operating System. Its builders rejoiced in the freedom of cheap disk accesses. The initial result was disastrous to performance.

In setting core sizes for each component, we had not simultaneously set access budgets. As anyone with 20-20 hindsight would expect, a programmer who found their program slopping over their core target broke it into overlays. This process in itself added to the total size and slowed execution down. Most seriously, our management control system neither measured nor caught this. Each man reported as to how much core he was using, and since he was within target, no one worried.

Fortunately, there came a day early in the effort when the OS/360 performance simulator began to work. The first result indicated deep trouble. Fortran H, on a Model 65 with drums, simulated compiling at five statements per minute! Digging-in showed that the control program modules were each making many, many disk accesses. Even high-frequency supervisor modules were making many trips to the well, and the result was quite analogous to page thrashing.

The first moral is clear: Set total size budgets as well as resident-space budgets; set budgets on backing-store accesses as well as on sizes.

The next lesson was very similar. The space budgets were set before precise functional allocations were made to each module. As a result, any programmer in size trouble examined their code to see what they could throw over the fence into a neighbor's space. So buffers managed by the control program became part of the user's space. More seriously, so did all kinds of control blocks, and the effect was utterly compromising to the security and protection of the system.

So the second moral is also clear: Define exactly what a module must do when you specify how big it must be.

A third and deeper lesson shows through these experiences. The project was large enough and management communication poor enough to prompt many members of the team to see themselves as contestants making brownie points, rather than as builders making programming products. Each suboptimized his piece to meet his targets; few stopped to think about the total effect on the customer. This breakdown in orientation and communication is a major hazard for large projects. All during implementation, the system architects must maintain continual vigilance to ensure continued system integrity. Beyond this policing mechanism, however, lies the matter of attitude of the implementers themselves. Fostering a total-system, user-oriented attitude may well be the most important function of the programming manager.

## Space Techniques

No amount of space budgeting and control can make a program small. That requires invention and craftsmanship.

Obviously, more function means more space, speed being held constant. So the first area of craftsmanship is in trading function for size. Here there comes an early and deep policy question. How much of that choice shall be reserved for the user? One can design a program with many optional features, each of which takes a little space. One can design a generator that will take an option list and tailor a program to it. But for any particular set of options, a more monolithic program would take less space. It's rather like a car; if the map light, cigarette lighter, and clock are priced together as a single option, the package will cost less than if one can choose each separately. So the designer must decide how fine-grained the user choice of options will be.

In designing a system for a range of memory sizes, another basic question arises. A limiting effect keeps the range of suitability from being made arbitrarily wide, even with fine-grained modularity of function. In the smallest system, most modules will be overlaid. A substantial part of the smallest system's resident space must be set aside as a transient or paging area into which other parts are fetched. The size of this determines the size of all modules. And breaking functions into small modules costs both performance and space. So a large system, which can afford a transient area twenty times as large, only saves accesses thereby. It still suffers in both speed and space because the module size is so small. This effect limits the maximum efficient system that can be generated from the modules of a small system.

The second area of craftsmanship is space-time trade-offs. For a given function, the more space, the faster. This is true over an amazingly large range. It is this fact that makes it feasible to set space budgets.

The manager can do two things to help their team make good space-time trade-offs. One is to ensure that they are trained in programming technique, not just left to rely on native wit and previous experience. For a new language or machine this is especially important. The peculiarities of its skillful use need to be learned quickly and shared widely, perhaps with special prizes or praises for new techniques.

The second is to recognize that programming has a technology, and components need to be fabricated. Every project needs a notebook full of good subroutines or macros for queuing, searching, hashing, and sorting. For each such function the notebook should have at least two programs, the quick and the squeezed. The development of such technology is an important realization task that can be done in parallel with system architecture.

## Representation Is the Essence of Programming

Beyond craftsmanship lies invention, and it is here that lean, spare, fast programs are born. Almost always these are the result of strategic breakthrough rather than tactical cleverness. Sometimes the strategic breakthrough will be a new algorithm, such as the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform or the substitution of an n log n sort for an nÂ² set of comparisons.

Much more often, strategic breakthrough will come from redoing the representation of the data or tables. This is where the heart of a program lies. Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowcharts; they'll be obvious.

It is easy to multiply examples of the power of representations. I recall a young man undertaking to build an elaborate console interpreter for an IBM 650. He ended up packing it onto an incredibly small amount of space by building an interpreter for the interpreter, recognizing that human interactions are slow and infrequent, but space was dear. Digitek's elegant little Fortran compiler uses a very dense, specialized representation for the compiler code itself, so that external storage is not needed. That time lost in decoding this representation is gained back tenfold by avoiding input-output. (The exercises at the end of Chapter 6 in Brooks and Iverson, _Automatic Data Processing_[^1] include a collection of such examples, as do many of Knuth's exercises.[^2])

The programmer at wit's end for lack of space can often do best by disentangling himself from his code, rearing back, and contemplating his data. Representation is the essence of programming.
