# Epilogue: Fifty Years of Wonder, Excitement, and Joy

Still vivid in my mind is the wonder and delight with which I—
then 13 years old—read the account of the August 7, 1944, dedication of the Harvard Mark I computer, an electromechanical
marvel for which Howard Aiken was the architect and IBM
engineers Clair Lake, Benjamin Durfee, and Francis Hamilton
were the implementation designers. Equally wonder-provoking
was the reading of Vannevar Bush's "That We May Think" paper
in the April 1945 *Atlantic Monthly*, in which he proposed organizing knowledge as a big hypertext web and giving users machines for both following existing trails and blazing new trails of
associations.

My passion for computers got another strong boost in 1952,
when a summer job at IBM in Endicott, New York, gave me
hands-on experience in programming the IBM 604 and formal
instruction in programming IBM's 701, its first stored-program
machine. Graduate school under Aiken and Iverson at Harvard
made my career dream a reality, and I was hooked for life. To
only a fraction of the human race does God give the privilege of
earning one's bread doing what one would have gladly pursued
free, for passion. I am very thankful.

It is hard to imagine a more exciting time to have lived as a
computer devotee. From mechanisms to vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits, the technology has exploded. The
first computer on which I worked, fresh out of Harvard, was the
IBM 7030 Stretch supercomputer. Stretch reigned as the world's
fastest computer from 1961 to 1964; nine copies were delivered.
My Macintosh Powerbook is today not only faster, with a larger
memory and bigger disk, it is a thousand times cheaper. (Five
thousand times cheaper in constant dollars.) We have seen in
turn the computer revolution, the electronic computer revolution, the minicomputer revolution, and the microcomputer revolution, each bringing orders-of-magnitude more computers.

The computer-related intellectual discipline has exploded as
has the technology. When I was a graduate student in the mid-1950s, I could read all the journals and conference proceedings;
I could stay current in all the discipline. Today my intellectual
life has seen me regretfully kissing subdiscipline interests goodbye one by one, as my portfolio has continuously overflowed
beyond mastery. Too many interests, too many exciting opportunities for learning, research, and thought. What a marvelous
predicament! Not only is the end not in sight, the pace is not
slackening. We have many future joys.
