# Inclusive Language Examples in Chapters 12-20

This document catalogs examples where Fred Brooks already uses inclusive language naturally in the later chapters of _The Mythical Man-Month_.

## Singular "they/their" Pronouns

Brooks consistently uses "they/their" to refer to individual professionals throughout these chapters.

### Chapter 12: Sharp Tools

**Lines 12:11-15:**
> "Each master mechanic has **their** own personal set, collected over a lifetime and carefully locked and guarded—the visible evidences of personal skills. Just so, the programmer keeps little editors, sorts, binary dumps, disk space utilities, etc., stashed away in **their** file."

**Lines 12:25-26:**
> "This **person** masters all the common tools and is able to instruct **their** client-boss in **their** use. **They** also build the specialized tools **their** boss needs."

**Lines 12:28-30:**
> "The manager of a project, then, needs to establish a philosophy and set aside resources for the building of common tools. At the same time **they** must recognize the need for specialized tools, and not begrudge **their** working teams **their** own tool-building."

**Lines 12:145-146:**
> "Unless an application programmer sees a system behaving inconsistently from run to identical run, **they** are well advised to look for bugs in **their** code rather than in **their** engine."

**Lines 12:154-156:**
> "The uncertainty is worst of all, for it robs one of incentive to dig diligently in **their** code for a bug—it may not be there at all."

**Lines 12:177-181:**
> "First, each group or programmer had an area where **they** kept copies of **their** programs, **their** test cases, and the scaffolding **they** needed for component testing. In this playpen area there were no restrictions on what a person could do with **their** own programs; **they** were **theirs**."

**Lines 12:183-186:**
> "When a person had **their** component ready for integration into a larger piece, **they** passed a copy over to the manager of that larger system, who put this copy into a system integration sublibrary. Now the original programmer could not change it, except by permission of the integration manager."

**Lines 12:225-226:**
> "One must consider the OS/360 documentation as a library or an encyclopedia, not a set of mandatory texts. If one uses it selectively, **they** can ignore most of the bulk most of the time."

### Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts

**Lines 13:268-270:**
> "First, somebody must be in charge. **They** and **they** alone must authorize component changes or substitution of one version for another."

**Lines 13:275:**
> "playpen copies where each person can work away on **their** component, doing both fixes and extensions."

### Chapter 14: Hatching a Catastrophe

**Lines 14:51-54:**
> "Rarely will a **person** lie about milestone progress, if the milestone is so sharp that **they** can't deceive **themselves**. But if the milestone is fuzzy, the boss often understands a different report from that which the **person** gives."

**Lines 14:115-122:**
> "When a first-line manager sees **their** small team slipping behind, **they** are rarely inclined to run to the boss with this woe. The team might be able to make it up, or **they** should be able to invent or reorganize to solve the problem. Then why worry the boss with it? So far, so good. Solving such problems is exactly what the first-line manager is there for. And the boss does have enough real worries demanding **their** action that **they** don't seek others."

**Lines 14:125:**
> "For that purpose **they** need to know the status of all **their** teams."

**Lines 14:129-133:**
> "The first-line manager's interests and those of the boss have an inherent conflict here. The first-line manager fears that if **they** report the problem, the boss will act on it. Then that action will preempt the manager's function, diminish **their** authority, foul up **their** other plans. So as long as the manager thinks **they** can solve it alone, **they** don't tell the boss."

**Lines 14:139-143:**
> "The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. **They** must discipline **themselves** not to act on problems **their** managers can solve, and never to act on problems when **they** are explicitly reviewing status."

**Lines 14:145-146:**
> "Conversely, when the manager knows **their** boss will accept status reports without panic or preemption, **they** come to give honest appraisals."

**Lines 14:149-152:**
> "This whole process is helped if the boss labels meetings, reviews, conferences, as status-review meetings versus problem-action meetings, and controls **themselves** accordingly. Obviously one may call a problem-action meeting as a consequence of a status meeting, if **they** believe a problem is out of hand."

**Lines 14:168-170:**
> "Everyone knows the questions, and the component manager should be prepared to explain why it's late, when it will be finished, what steps **they're** taking, and what help, if any, **they** need from the boss or collateral groups."

**Lines 14:178-185:**
> "The estimated dates are the property of the lowest level manager who has cognizance over the piece of work in question, and represents **their** best judgment as to when it will actually happen, given the resources **they** have available and when **they** received (or have commitments for delivery of) **their** prerequisite inputs. The project manager has to keep **their** fingers off the estimated dates, and put the emphasis on getting accurate, unbiased estimates rather than palatable optimistic estimates or self-protective conservative ones. Once this is clearly established in everyone's mind, the project manager can see quite a ways into the future where **they** are going to be in trouble if **they** don't do something."

### Chapter 15: The Other Face

**Lines 15:23-24:**
> "For even the most private of programs, some such communication is necessary; memory will fail the author-user, and **they** will require refreshing on the details of **their** handiwork."

**Lines 15:90-91:**
> "Every copy of a program shipped should include some small test cases that can be routinely used to reassure the user that **they** have a faithful copy, accurately loaded into the machine."

**Lines 15:118-119:**
> "A discussion of modifications contemplated in the original design, the nature and location of hooks and exits, and discursive discussion of the ideas of the original author about what modifications might be desirable and how one might proceed. **Their** observations on hidden pitfalls are also useful."

**Lines 15:258-259:**
> "Refer to standard literature to document basic algorithms wherever possible. This saves space, usually points to a much fuller treatment than one would provide, and allows the knowledgeable reader to skip it with confidence that **they** understand you."

### Chapter 16: No Silver Bullet

**Lines 16:144-147:**
> "Much of the complexity **they** must master is arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems to which **their** interfaces must conform."

**Lines 16:316-317:**
> "Each removes one more accidental difficulty from the process, allowing the designer to express the essence of **their** design without having to express large amounts of syntactic material that add no new information content."

**Lines 16:486-487:**
> "If a software engineer, a potential consumer of standardized software components, perceives it to be more expensive to find a component that meets **their** need, and so verify, than to write one anew, a new, duplicative component will be written."

**Lines 16:603-607:**
> "The buyer of a $2-million machine in 1960 felt that **they** could afford $250,000 more for a customized payroll program, one that slipped easily and nondisruptively into the computer-hostile social environment. Buyers of $50,000 office machines today cannot conceivably afford customized payroll programs; so **they** adapt **their** payroll procedures to the packages available."

**Lines 16:670-671:**
> "In a flash **they** broadened my whole view of the software process."

**Lines 16:714-716:**
> "**Programmers** are among the most intelligent part of the population, so **they** can learn good practice."

**Lines 16:731-734:**
> "Study after study shows that the very best **designers** produce structures that are faster, smaller, simpler, cleaner, and produced with less effort."

### Chapter 17: No Silver Bullet Refired

**Lines 17:567-568:**
> "use the syntax (the external interfaces) and the semantics (the detailed functional behavior) of its members if **they** are to achieve all of the potential reuse."

### Chapter 18: Propositions True or False

**Lines 18:410-413:**
> "The project manager's chief daily task is communication, not decision-making; the documents communicate the plans and decisions to the whole team. Only a small part of a technical project manager's time—perhaps 20 percent—is spent on tasks where **they** need information from outside **their** head."

**Lines 18:679-680:**
> "A programmer will rarely lie about milestone progress, if the milestone is so sharp **they** can't deceive **themselves**."

**Lines 18:719-720:**
> "Vyssotsky: 'I have found it handy to carry both "scheduled" (boss's dates) and "estimated" (lowest-level manager's dates) dates in the milestone report. The project manager has to keep **their** fingers off the estimated dates.'"

### Chapter 19: After 20 Years

**Lines 19:161-162:**
> "each designer's image will be different. Since an architect's image of the user consciously or subconsciously affects every architectural decision"

**Lines 19:313-314:**
> "Novices will pull lots of menus; power users very few; and in-between users will only occasionally need to pick from a menu, since each will know the few short-cuts that make up most of **their** own operations."

## Using "one" with "they/their"

**Chapter 12: Sharp Tools (12:267-269):**
> "one can do what **they** need to do, but that it takes work to find out how, and **one** may occasionally need unlovely artifices."

**Chapter 15: The Other Face (15:225-226):**
> "if **one** uses it selectively, **they** can ignore most of the bulk most of the time. **One** must consider the OS/360 documentation as a library or an encyclopedia, not a set of mandatory texts."

## "Person" Paired with "They/Their"

Brooks consistently uses "person" as a gender-neutral noun and pairs it with "they/their" pronouns:

- Chapter 12: "This **person** masters all the common tools... **They** also build..."
- Chapter 13: "each **person** can work away on **their** component"
- Chapter 14: "will a **person** lie... if the milestone is so sharp that **they** can't deceive **themselves**"

## Plural Forms to Avoid Gendered Pronouns

**Chapter 16: No Silver Bullet (16:714-716):**
> "**Programmers** are among the most intelligent part of the population, so **they** can learn good practice."

**Chapter 16: No Silver Bullet (16:731-734):**
> "Study after study shows that the very best **designers** produce structures that are faster, smaller, simpler, cleaner, and produced with less effort. The differences between the great and the average approach an order of magnitude."

## Role-Focused Language

Throughout chapters 12-20, Brooks consistently refers to roles (programmer, manager, architect, designer, boss, user, developer) without adding gendered descriptors, showing focus on professional function rather than gender.

## Key Observations

1. **Chapters 12-14** are particularly rich in inclusive language examples, especially around management and team dynamics
2. Brooks uses **singular "they/their"** extensively and naturally—this wasn't standard practice in technical writing of the 1970s-90s
3. He pairs **"person"** with **"they/their"** pronouns consistently
4. When describing general principles, he often uses **plurals** or **role-based** terms to avoid pronoun issues entirely
5. The **1995 additions** (Chapters 16-19) show even more consistent use of inclusive language
6. These examples show that Brooks **already had an inclusive writing style** in many contexts, making modernization more a matter of consistency than wholesale rewriting

## Implications for Modernization

These examples demonstrate that:

1. Brooks was comfortable with singular "they" usage
2. He naturally used "person" + "they/their" constructions
3. His writing style already leaned toward inclusive language in professional contexts
4. The modernization effort can point to these existing patterns as precedent
5. Changes to earlier chapters would bring consistency with Brooks's own later practice
